# Assets Directory

## Logo Files

Place the yellowHEAD logo file here with one of these names:
- `yellowhead_logo.png`
- `yellowhead_logo.svg`
- `logo.png`
- `logo.svg`

The presentation service will automatically detect and use the logo file if it exists in this directory.

If no logo file is found, the system will use a text-based representation of "yellowHEAD | AI Strategy" in the top-left corner of each slide.
